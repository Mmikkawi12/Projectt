# üß† Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms on Economic Networks

## üìä Overview

We analyzed five real-world economic and trade network datasets obtained from [networkrepository.com](https://networkrepository.com/), aiming to study how various Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms perform in terms of scalability, efficiency, and cost optimization. The five MST algorithms implemented are:

- **Kruskal's Algorithm**
- **Prim's Algorithm**
- **Bor≈Øvka's Algorithm**
- **Reverse-delete Algorithm**
- **Karger's Min-Cut Algorithm** (included for comparison)

## üß† Observations

- **Prim and Kruskal** consistently performed best in terms of speed and gave identical MST costs across all datasets.
- **Bor≈Øvka** was slightly slower due to its multi-component nature but is still efficient for parallel settings.
- **Reverse-delete** produced slightly cheaper MSTs in some cases but was much slower and computationally expensive.
- **Karger** is included as a min-cut reference and not directly comparable in MST context.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Insights

- For dense graphs (e.g., `econ-psmigr1`), Kruskal and Prim scale best.
- For sparse graphs (`econ-beause`, `econ-wm1`), all algorithms perform efficiently.
- Reverse-delete is not suitable for large datasets due to its slowness despite slightly better cost in a few cases.
- Karger is effective for cut analysis but should not be used for MST.
